# Ben-Lui_CDM0517
Intermittency experiment examining the timings of steering corrections across bends of varying radii. The driver steers across a ground-plane and a road 'appears' in front of them. They need to attempt to stay on the road. After a few seconds the road will disappear.

**master** branch contains initial programming efforts. The key file is helpfully named 'Ben-Lui_beta_tiles_road.py', that uses a perspective road (viz.QUAD) rather than a single line (viz.LINE, as in 'Ben-Lui_beta.py' and 'Ben-Lui_beta2.py').

### Running The Code

- Download a trial version of Vizard5 or 6.

- Clone the github repository.

- Load Ben-Lui_beta2.py into Vizard.

- Click Run. 

**Update** branch is for updating the initial pilot programming to the new setup. The update is not operational yet. The update will include:
- integrated eyetracking
- wheel automation to centre wheel after initial steering correction.
- Better ways of saving the data for our new workflow using our scripts in python and R.
